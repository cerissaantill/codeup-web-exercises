        <h1>jQuery Exercise</h1>

        <p>It's a very cold picture, I may have to go get my coat. Itâ€™s about to
            freeze me to death. Play with the angles. We don't really know where
            this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>You need the dark in order to show the light.</li>
                <li>Let's have a nice tree right here.</li>
                <li>That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington.</li>
                <li>Talk to trees, look at the birds. Whatever it takes.</li>
            </ul>
